# A11y Shooter

## Intro
A11y Shooter is a proof of concept game, distributed as a bookmarklet, that
will turn any page into an interactive shooter. The aim of the game is to
shoot `alt` tags at images on the page.

## What would the full version do?
A full working and useful version of A11y Shooter would cross-check the
accessibility tags that players shoot at images with the existing `alt` tag and
the Google Vision API to give them a score based on how accurate their
description was.

## Why is this useful?
A11y Shooter is a [game with a purpose](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1378719).
Theoretically, the players of this game can provide incredibly accurate and
useful information about images on web pages. This data can be used to
help improve the accessibility of the web, all whilst making the boring
task of labelling images for the semantic web fun.
